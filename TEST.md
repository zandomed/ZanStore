# Exam scenario:
You are a PHP developer tasked with building an API for a new e-commerce platform using Laravel framework. The API should allow customers to view, create, update, and delete products and manage their accounts.

Your task is to build the API endpoints and write basic functionality for each endpoint. You should also ensure that the API can handle errors and returns appropriate responses.

## Exam steps:

- Create a new Laravel project and configure the database connection.

- Create a controller for the API and define the necessary functions for each endpoint.

- Create an endpoint that allows customers to view all available products. The endpoint should return a JSON array of product objects, including the product name, price, description, and image.

- Create an endpoint that allows customers to view a specific product by ID. The endpoint should return a JSON object containing the product information.

- Create an endpoint that allows customers to create a new product. The endpoint should accept a JSON object containing the product name, price, description, and image. The endpoint should return a JSON object containing the new product's ID and other relevant information.

- Create an endpoint that allows customers to update an existing product by ID. The endpoint should accept a JSON object containing the product name, price, description, and image. The endpoint should return a JSON object containing the updated product's ID and other relevant information.

- Create an endpoint that allows customers to delete a product by ID. The endpoint should return a JSON object containing the deleted product's ID and other relevant information.

- Create an endpoint that allows customers to view their account information. The endpoint should return a JSON object containing the customer's name, email, and other relevant information.

- Handle errors in the API by returning appropriate error messages and HTTP status codes. Examples of errors to handle include invalid data in requests, missing data in requests, and incorrect authentication credentials.

- Use appropriate security measures to protect the API, such as implementing rate limiting, securing sensitive data, and using SSL encryption.
